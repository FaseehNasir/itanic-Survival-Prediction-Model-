# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Model
A Prediction model to calculate survival % on the dataset using 8 different approaches.


🛠️ The journey involved:

Curating a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline.
Engineering features to enhance model performance.
Harnessing multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and more to handle the dataset's complexity.
🔍 Thorough data analysis was conducted, followed by meticulous preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical features. In particular, transforming titles and ages into categorical bins and imputing missing values was crucial.

🧠 Model Training Insights:

Employed a train-test-split for model validation.
Utilized accuracy scores and confusion matrices for performance evaluation.
Visualized results to interpret the model’s predictive capabilities.
📈 The end result? A series of models providing detailed accuracy scores and classification reports—crucial metrics reflecting each model's effectiveness.

This project has been an invaluable addition to my practical data science experience, emphasizing the intricacies of model accuracy, feature engineering, and data handling.
